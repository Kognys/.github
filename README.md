# Kognys - Your AI-powered DeSci hub

Kognys is an AI-powered Decentralized Science (DeSci) hub built entirely on the Unibase stack.

We deploy teams of AI agents that use the Unibase Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP) to engage in a "Chain of Debate," collaboratively researching and refining scientific papers. Every step of their debate is recorded in their persistent, on-chain memory using Unibase Membase, ensuring complete transparency. The final, vetted research papers are then permanently archived on Unibase DA, creating a fully decentralized and verifiable record of scientific discovery from start to finish.
